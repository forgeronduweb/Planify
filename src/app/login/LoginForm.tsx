// Note: This component might have originally contained the form logic,

// The original structure seemed to use an AuthForm component imported from @/app/components/AuthForm

// Restoring to a state that likely existed before the LoginForm component was extensively modified
// for inline form handling and black/white styling.
// If AuthForm was the original component used directly by the page, this file might not have been needed.
// Based on the diff, the page imported LoginForm, and LoginForm used AuthForm previously.
// Let's revert LoginForm to a state that imports AuthForm, as seen in the first line.
